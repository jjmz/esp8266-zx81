/* Write the following macros for memory access and input/output on the Z80. 
 *
 * Z80_FETCH_BYTE() and Z80_FETCH_WORD() are used by the emulator to read the
 * code (opcode, constants, displacement, etc). The upper 16-bit of the address
 * parameters is undefined and must be reset to zero before actually reading 
 * memory (use & 0xffff). The value x read, must be an unsigned 8-bit or 16-bit
 * value in the endianness of the host processor.
 *
 * Z80_READ_BYTE(), Z80_WRITE_BYTE(), Z80_READ_WORD(), and Z80_WRITE_WORD()
 * are used for general memory access. They obey the same rule as the code 
 * reading macros. The upper bits of the value x to write may be non-zero.
 * 
 * Z80_INPUT_BYTE() and Z80_OUTPUT_BYTE() are for input and output. The upper
 * bits of the port number to read or write are always zero. The input byte x 
 * must be an unsigned 8-bit value. The value x to write is an unsigned 8-bit 
 * with its upper bits zeroes.
 *
 * All macros have access to the following variables:
 *
 *      state           Pointer to the current Z80_STATE. Member registers is
 *                      most likely not up to date because the current 
 *                      executing instruction is working on it.
 *
 *      pc              Current PC register (upper bits are undefined). It
 *                      points on the displacement or constant to read for
 *                      Z80_FETCH_BYTE() and Z80_FETCH_WORD(), or on the next
 *                      instruction otherwise.
 *              
 *      number_cycles   Number of cycles to emulate. Set number_cycles to zero
 *                      if you want to quit emulation after completion of the
 *                      current instruction.
 *
 *      elapsed_cycles  Number of cycles emulated, you may add wait states
 *                      for slow memory accesses as needed.
 *
 *      instruction     Type of the currently executing instruction, see
 *                      instructions.h for a list.
 *
 *      registers       Current register decoding table, it points on 
 *                      dd_register_table for 0xdd prefixed instructions, 
 *                      fd_register_table for 0xfd ones, or register_table
 *                      otherwise.
 *
 *      opcode          Opcode of the currently executing instruction, check
 *                      register_table for 0xdd or 0xfd prefixes.
